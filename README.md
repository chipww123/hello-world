## About Me

Hello! My name is Clayton Copus and I'm a student at SWIC majoring in CIS. I work in a hospital as a housekeeper and I've been there for almost 5 years.  
In my free time I enjoy playing video games, watching movies and listening to music. Sadly now that the school year has started, I will mostly be doing homework and also just work.
